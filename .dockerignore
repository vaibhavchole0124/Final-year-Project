# We might want to include models if they are needed for baking into the image, 
# or exclude them if we mount them as volumes. 
# For now, let's include models but exclude local data/logs.
# Re-including models line by commenting out exclusion if they were excluded.
# Actually, the user's current setup has models inside the repo.
